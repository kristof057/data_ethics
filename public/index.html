        <h1>The Neighborhood Dog</h1>
        <p class="p-general">We’re reaching out to get your thoughts on which dog breeds you think are best suited for our neighborhood.
           Your input will help paint a clearer picture of how residents feel about various dog breeds, 
           especially those often considered potentially dangerous.</p>
    
        <p class="p-general">Please take a moment to share your views on which breeds you believe fit well into our local parks,
           streets, and communal areas, and which might not. This feedback is crucial for us to understand community preferences
           and ensure everyone feels safe and happy in our shared spaces.</p>
            
        <p class="p-general">Thank you for helping us make our neighborhood a better place for all residents and their furry friends!
           Your opinions are highly valued.</p>
