    <h2 class="h2-general">Data Privacy Policy for A/B Testing</h2>

    <p class="p-policy">This Data Privacy Policy elucidates the protocols of Dog Neighborhood Watch ("we," "us," or "our") regarding
       the collection, use, processing, and disclosure of personal information gathered through our A/B testing activities. 
       We are committed to safeguarding the privacy and security of all personal data under our stewardship, ensuring 
       transparency in our experimental methodologies and data handling practices.</p>

    <h2 class="h2-general">Understanding A/B Testing</h2>
    <p class="p-policy">A/B testing, also referred to as split testing, is a methodological approach where two or more variants of a
       digital interface are presented to different segments of website visitors at random. This technique allows us
       to statistically analyze which variant drives better performance towards predetermined objectives such as enhanced
       user engagement or increased conversion rates.</p>

    <h2 class="h2-general">Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p class="p-policy">In the course of conducting A/B testing, we collect several types of data to evaluate the effectiveness of test variants.
    This data includes, but is not limited to, Personal Identification Information (PII) such as names, email addresses,
    and contact details, which are gathered to facilitate user interaction. User Interaction Data, encompassing clicks, scroll
    behavior, and navigation paths, is collected to understand user engagement with different interface designs. 
    Additionally, Device and Access Information, which includes the type of device, operating system, browser type, 
    and IP addresses, is used to infer demographic and geographic insights.</p>

    <p class="p-policy">The purpose behind collecting this data is manifold. Primarily, it allows us to ascertain the influence of different
    webpage or application elements on user behavior, thereby enabling us to tailor and enhance the user experience effectively.
    The data also aids in the continuous improvement of our digital assets, ensuring they remain efficient, user-friendly, 
    and capable of meeting our users' needs.</p>

    <h2 class="h2-general">Disclosure of Information</h2>
    <p class="p-policy">To facilitate our services, we engage with third-party service providers who perform tasks on our behalf,
    such as data analysis and marketing assistance. These third parties are granted access to personal data solely
    for the purpose of executing these tasks and are bound by confidentiality agreements to ensure the security and
    privacy of your data. Additionally, we may disclose your data to comply with legal obligations, 
    respond to law enforcement requests, or protect the rights, property, or safety of our organization, our users, or others.</p>
